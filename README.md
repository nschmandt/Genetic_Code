# Genetic_Code
This is code that I used to analyze transcriptome expression levels in different samples.

The file without any description was used to analyze the Venus Flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) Transcriptome, and the code with the suffix "cnidarian" was used to analyze the Nematostella Transcriptome.
