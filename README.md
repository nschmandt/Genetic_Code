# Genetic_Code
This is code that I used to analyze transcriptome expression levels in different samples.

The file without any description was used to analyze the Venus Flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) Transcriptome, and the code with the suffix "cnidarian" was used to analyze the Nematostella Transcriptome.

The linux bash script trinity_analysis_align_estimate_runscript is the initial dataset analysis in the linux bash shell environment. The Rscripts then use this data to compare and determine sets of genes differentially expressed, as well as some of the protein features such as the number of transmembrane helices.
